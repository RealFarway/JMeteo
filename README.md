# JMeteo

Small weather Web-App to practice Java with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, Hibernate and MS SQL Server.

To have the app work in local you will need an OpenCage API key: https://opencagedata.com
and also an OpenWeatherMap API key: https://home.openweathermap.org

Development ongoing.
