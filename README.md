# JMeteo

Small weather Web-App to practice Java with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, Hibernate and MS SQL Server.

To have the app work in local you will need an OpenCage API key: https://opencagedata.com
and also an OpenWeatherMap API key: https://home.openweathermap.org
Also you need to uncomment the code in data.sql and run the program once (then comment it again) or just run it on SQL after the DB was created.


Development ongoing.
